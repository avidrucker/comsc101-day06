# SDM: This program will take in user input in the 
# format of HH:MM where the digits can represent any
# valid 12 hour clock time, so for example, 01:59 
# would be 01:59 AM or PM. After taking in a time, 
# 1 more user input will be a positive integer which
# ticks the clock forward that many minutes & display 
# the new time. Program will politely & clearly ask 
# the user to put in the required info
# Bonus Points: (1) handle seconds also, so instead 
# of taking in minutes to tick forward, it will take 
# in seconds to tick forward. (2) Handle AM/PM inputs 
# and outputs
# Due date: End of day Monday (11:59pm)
